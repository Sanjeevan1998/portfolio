    premise: 'Trapped by a raging monsoon blackout and the comforting echoes of her father\'s playlist, Ayesha finds her sanctuary shattered.',
    // --- Full story text below ---
    fullText: `It was bucketing down just like any other drizzly monsoon night. The sound of drops pitter-pattering on the rooftop went through Ayesha’s headphones.

After her usual tiring weekday routines, Ayesha always felt comfort within the walls of her own room. Ever since she lost her father a couple of years ago, she has become more timid and withdrawn from the world. Before he passed away he gave her his old iPod as a deathbed gift. And ever since that day, she listened to his playlists whenever she could.

Suddenly the weather got worse and the sky got angrier. Blinding flashes of lightning gave a stunning view out of Ayesha’s window. Out of the blue, an unexpected bolt of lightning hit a power grid nearby, which resulted in an area-wide blackout. Luckily, Ayesha had some candles which she received on her last birthday tucked away in her cupboard. She quickly hauled out two of them from the set of four. She used her dad’s lighter to light the candles and placed one on her table and another on the shelf above her bed. The flames irradiated just enough light for Ayesha to continue her sketch of the puppy she saw that morning while she was on her way to school. She put her headphones back on while reminiscing about her encounter with the young pup.

Time passed by but the rain did not stop. It was almost midnight. Ayesha was almost done with her sketch. The white Maltese was smiling through the portrait as if he was satisfied with how he was drawn.
Lost in her own world she didn't realise it was way past her usual dinner time. The slight peckish that she was feeling a couple of hours ago had turned into borderline starvation. Even so, she didn't want to rush her mom as she knew how strenuous it was to work the whole day and then come home and cook for two people. She tries to lend a hand to her mother but she isn’t much of any help when it comes to cooking. She is the type of person who burns the pot while boiling water.

Ayesha’s mother always lets herself in with the second pair of keys. After a quick refreshing bath, she cooks dinner, spends time with her daughter and both enjoy dinner together in their kitchen downstairs. After their meal, Ayesha helps with the dishes and tucks her mom to sleep. Ever since she lost her husband, falling asleep has been difficult. She also claimed that she could hear voices whispering to her from time to time. So Ayesha waits till she falls asleep and then ambles back across the hallway to her room which is on the same floor.

After some time passed by Ayesha felt like someone yelled her name from downstairs. Ayesha relieved that finally food was ready, removed her headphones and replied “Coming Ma”. Just when she was about to get off her bed and rush downstairs she realised her mom never yells to call for dinner. She always comes up to share how each other’s day went and both go downstairs together to eat. Since Ayesha had her headphones on, she thought what she heard might have been some random background music from the song that resonated with her name. To make sure she asked, “Did you call me Ma? Is the dinner ready yet”. She waited for a reply but all she heard was the continuous sound of pluvial rainfall. After asking a few more times, Ayesha gave up. She put her headphones back and was just about to press the play button when she heard a voice again.” AYESHA!” It was clear this time. With the absence of a song playing through her headphones, she was sure that it was her mother who was calling her name.
Without thinking much, she immediately jumped out of her bed, put her slippers on, and started walking towards her door. Just when she was about to grab the doorknob, she heard the creaking sound of the wooden floorboards. It was coming from the other end of the hallway where her dad’s study room used to be. With every moment passing by, the sound was getting louder as if someone was slowly walking towards Ayesha’s room. Ayesha thought to herself that it must be her mother who has come to spend some time with her before dinner like she usually does.
At that exact moment, she heard her mom’s voice again but not from the other side of the door. It was again coming from downstairs but with a slightly vexed tone. Upon hearing the voice again, Ayesha was startled. If her mom is still downstairs then who do these footsteps belong to on her floor? She bolted to the entrance of her room and locked up the door. Before she could ponder about the current situation, she heard another voice. But this time, it came from the other side of the door.“Ayesha, I heard that voice too! Don’t go downstairs. I don’t know who that is”.The figure outside her room continued in a soft breathy voice resembling that of Ayesha’s mother. “I am scared. Please let me in.”

When Ayesha heard this her blood ran cold. She couldn’t figure out what to do. She didn’t know who to believe. She was stuck in a grave dilemma. What if the one below is her real mother? Who has no idea that an intruder is inside their home? And if Ayesha soon does not come downstairs her mother might come up and run into whoever is in the hallway. Or what if the one in the hallway is her real mother? And letting her in could save her from imminent danger that is prowling downstairs.
Ayesha knew she couldn’t afford to be petrified in fear. She has to do something. She can’t be panic-stricken. So she decided to pull herself together. She breathed in and out as her mind began to linger. After calming down a bit, she began looking for a way to call for help. . But how? Her exits were blocked. No one around would hear her scream because of the heavy rain outside. Nor can she get to her mother. Suddenly an idea struck her mind. She didn’t need to scream or get out of the house. All she has to do is get to her phone. Then she can call the cops as well as inform her neighbors. Without wasting any time she ran towards her bed. Looked for her phone which was tucked deep under her pillow. She grabbed her phone with her shaky fingers. Turned on the display. In the first glimpse, she saw 12 missed calls from her mom. Right below was another notification. It was a text message. Her eyes followed through. It was from her mom. The text read
“Hi Ayesha, I’ve been trying to reach you so many times but you didn’t pick up. Your dinner is in the fridge, eat without me and don't wait up. I will not be back home today due to work. Goodnight. See you tomorrow.”`

    premise: 'Returning to his childhood home, Zeeshan encounters a mysterious neighbor, leading to a night that blends reality and myth.',
    // --- Full story text below ---
    fullText: `It had been more than a decade since Zeeshan last heard the chiming of the wind chime in his previous home. The pots outside the villa where once resided his mother’s favorite flowers were now covered with dust and cobwebs. The cleaners were supposed to come soon to clean the house and make it habitable again.

Mr. and Mrs. Bharucha had built a beautiful life in the bustling city of Mumbai. Mr. Bharucha’s real estate business was thriving, and to celebrate his success, they planned a short trip to another city with close friends. It was meant to be just a two-day getaway, so they hired a nanny to look after their five-year-old son, Zeeshan. Despite a nagging feeling of unease, Mrs. Bharucha’s concern was eased by her husband, who reassured her that everything would be fine—they weren’t leaving him forever, after all. But fate had other plans. What should have been a brief trip stretched on far longer than expected. When three days passed without a word from the Bharuchas, the worried nanny contacted the police. After a week-long search, they found Zeeshan's parents' car wrecked in a ditch. The tragic event meant Zeeshan had no choice but to move in with his grandparents.

But now, more than twelve years have passed. The once little boy has grown into a sharp, young man. After finishing high school in the quiet countryside, Zeeshan decided it was time to return to the city. And what better way to begin this new chapter than by moving back into his childhood home?

Zeeshan still remembered fragments of his childhood in this house. He could almost hear his mother playing the piano, with him sitting beside her, eagerly trying to guess the next tune she’d play. He remembered how his father would pull up in the driveway, and he’d run through the hallway to greet him. But now, everything has changed. For one, the area around his home had become much more crowded. What was once a quiet space had turned into a bustling neighborhood. There was even an apartment building right in front of his living room, so close that if you go out to the balcony of his floor, you could see straight into the bedroom of one of its apartments.
He tried his best to resist the urge to look into the apartment, but his curiosity eventually won. He turned his head casually, pretending to take in the full view of the horizon, convincing himself that he wasn’t intentionally peeking into someone’s home—just glancing around and accidentally catching a glimpse. Unfortunately for him, the window was covered with thick curtains, blocking any direct view inside.
But there was a slight gap between the curtains through which he could see a modest, slightly messy yet oddly organized room. A small bed, unmade but tidy, sat in the corner. On a nearby table rested a ukulele, and a chair, draped with a pile of clothes. As much as he hoped it belonged to a girl, imagining a "You Belong With Me" moment sometime in the future, there was no clear indication. The items were too generic to guess a person’s identity. Still, one thing was certain: whoever lived there had a passion for music, a shared interest that assured Zeeshan that they’d eventually get along. The collection of kalimbas displayed in a cabinet only confirmed it.

Days went by, but the identity of the person living across from him remained a mystery. Zeeshan’s curiosity was insatiable; he desperately wanted to know who occupied the room opposite his. So, every now and then, he made an effort to catch a glimpse of the occupant.

Just as he had hoped, someone appeared at the window to shut it. Even though they didn’t notice him playing, he caught a clear glimpse of her, and it was a sight to behold. There she was—a beautiful girl with striking features: long, wavy hair that danced in the wind, bright, expressive eyes filled with concern, and a relieved smile that lit up her face as she managed to close the window just in time before the rain started. He felt an odd familiarity about her, as if he had seen her somewhere before, even though he knew he hadn’t.
Without realizing it, a smile spread across Zeeshan's face. Maybe this was the beginning of his first city love story! He chuckled to himself, grateful that she hadn’t noticed him just yet; After all, nothing says “romantic first encounter” like a guy lurking by the balcony, guitar in hand, wide-eyed and grinning like an idiot. The thought made him cringe, and he quickly shook his head, hoping she’d never know how close he had come to being that wierd guy.

The window stayed shut most of the time, and even when it was open, Zeeshan couldn’t just peek over like a creep to introduce himself. He hoped they might meet in the common space below his villa and the apartment where the girl lived, or perhaps they would run into each other somewhere else, and he could feign surprise that they were neighbors. Zeeshan imagined countless scenarios, but none of them ever materialized. Weeks went by, and the girl remained a complete stranger.

Zeeshan loved to sit at his mom’s old piano and play it during the nights. This particular evening felt especially poignant. It was the night his parents had left for a party, and he missed them more than usual. He settled onto the piano bench, gazing out at the sky through the living room's large window. The full moon bathed the world in silver light, illuminating the trees outside and casting gentle shadows on the ground. He could see the leaves rustling softly in the breeze, and the outlines of distant rooftops stood stark against the night. Everything felt serene, yet there was a bittersweet edge to it, amplifying his sense of longing as he played.
As he played through the night, Zeeshan noticed a figure on the terrace of the building directly across from him—the very same building whose window faced his balcony. His heart raced with possibilities. Maybe this is her! Perhaps today is the day I can find an excuse to go meet her. He considered stepping outside and just saying hi, thinking it might lift his spirits. But doubt crept in. What if she just wants to be alone? What if I disturb her solitude? He wrestled with his thoughts, unsure whether to stay at the piano or call it a night. It was getting late, after all. Yet, he couldn’t tear his gaze away from the figure, trying to decipher what they were doing all alone on the terrace.

As Zeeshan wrestled with his swirling thoughts about what to do, he saw the figure move closer to the edge of the building. His heart skipped a beat when he realized it was indeed her. Initially, a wave of happiness washed over him—his guess had been right—but it was quickly replaced by concern. Why is she so close to the edge?

A rush of anxious possibilities flooded his mind. Maybe she likes the thrill. But what if she doesn’t? What if she’s up there for a different reason? He remembered the scars on her wrists from that brief glimpse he'd caught earlier; he had tried to dismiss them, but now they haunted him. What if she’s suicidal?
Panic set in as he battled with his thoughts. Maybe I’m overreacting, but what if I’m not? He couldn’t bear the thought of doing nothing if something terrible were to happen right in front of him. The fear of looking foolish seemed trivial compared to the possibility of being right.
With a sudden surge of urgency, he jumped up from the piano and dashed out of his home, determined to reach her before it was too late.

He quickly reached the building across from him and bolted through the main door. The lobby was quiet, and one of the elevators was already at the ground floor, but he didn’t even glance at it. Fueled by adrenaline, he sprinted toward the stairs, taking them two at a time. Within a couple of minutes, he had climbed eight floors, his heart pounding in his chest.

As he approached the terrace door, he could see the faint outline of the figure against the night sky. Without pausing for breath, he pushed open the door and rushed onto the terrace. The air was cool and filled with a sense of urgency as he spotted her standing at the edge, her silhouette framed by the moonlight.

“Hey!” he called out, trying to keep his voice steady despite the rising panic inside him. “Please, be careful!”

He watched as she turned slightly, her expression one of surprise mixed with apprehension. Was she startled by his sudden appearance or his plea? Either way, he felt the weight of the moment pressing down on him. With every step he took toward her, he could see her clearer—her worried eyes reflecting the moonlight, her body tense with uncertainty.

“Don’t move too close to the edge,” he urged, trying to gauge her reaction. “I just… I saw you from my place, and I was worried. I thought you might need someone to talk to.”

There was a sudden relief on her face. She replied, “I might be sleepwalking again!” in a forced tone, as if she were hiding something. Zeeshan noticed something was a bit off but didn’t dwell on it too much, feeling relieved that nothing bad had happened.

She laughed lightly, though it sounded a bit strained. “Yeah, I can imagine. Sleepwalking can be a bit of a hazard, especially on a rooftop.” Her eyes darted back to the edge for a moment, and Zeeshan felt his heart race again.

“Maybe you should put up some barriers or something?” he suggested, half-joking, trying to lighten the mood. “Or at least get a few pillows to soften the fall if you end up sleepwalking near the edge again!”
Her lips curled into a small smile, and he felt a sense of warmth spread through him. “That’s a good idea. I’ll keep that in mind next time I decide to take a stroll on the terrace sleeping”

Zeeshan noticed her demeanor had softened, but there was still a hint of something deeper lurking beneath the surface. “I live right across the street.” He gestured toward his building, hoping to ease the tension. “I didn’t get your name…?”

“Amira,” she replied, her voice steadying. “It’s nice to finally meet a new neighbor, even if the circumstances are a bit unusual.”

“Yeah, unusual is one way to put it,” he chuckled, feeling more at ease now. “So, do you sleepwalk often?”

She hesitated for a moment, glancing away as if gathering her thoughts. “Not really, this is the second time actually.” she said finally, her tone lighter but still tinged with something unspoken. “But I promise I’ll be more careful.”

Zeeshan nodded, relieved but still curious about her true feelings. “Good. Because I’d rather not make a habit of playing the hero,” he joked, trying to lighten the mood further. “But if you ever need someone to keep an eye on you, I’m just a call away.”

Amira laughed softly, and for the first time, she looked genuinely relieved. “I appreciate that. It’s nice to know that there’s someone out there who is willing to save me from these stupid things I call upon myself.”

They stood there for a moment, the tension easing as the night air wrapped around them, both feeling the strange connection that had formed in such an unexpected situation.

“But I will need a name though; otherwise, how will I know whom to reach when I call them?” Amira said, and Zeeshan realized he never introduced himself properly.

“I am Zeeshan, and I’ve recently moved into the villa in front of us. It’s my family home, and now I’m back here.”

“What about you?” Zeeshan asked, genuinely curious.

“Well, as I mentioned, I’m Amira. I moved here last year for college. This apartment used to belong to my aunt, but she passed away a few years back, and it’s been empty ever since.”

Zeeshan nodded, intrigued by her story. They began to share anecdotes about their lives—Amira talked about her college experiences and how she was adjusting to living alone, while Zeeshan shared memories of his childhood in the villa. They found themselves laughing over silly moments and exchanging thoughts about their favorite music.

As the conversation flowed effortlessly, they lost track of time, completely absorbed in each other’s stories. The world around them faded away, and the sky gradually transformed from the dark blues of night to the soft hues of dawn. The first chirps of birds began to fill the air, signaling the start of a new day, but neither of them seemed to notice. They were too caught up in the warmth of their newfound connection, excited to learn more about each other.

Suddenly realizing how much time had passed, Amira noted, "It's almost time for me to wake up, and I haven't even slept. But it was really great talking to you."

Zeeshan smiled. "Oh, is it? I completely lost track of time! But I’m glad I got to know you. We should definitely do this again sometime—minus the part where you sleepwalk on the edges, of course!"

Amira smiled and nodded with agreement, and with that, they both said their goodbyes and headed back to their respective homes, still smiling from the unexpected night.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, with Zeeshan and Amira growing closer with each passing moment. They would often meet on their balconies, exchanging smiles and stories under the moonlight. Slowly, their conversations shifted from casual small talk to late-night heart-to-hearts, where they shared their dreams, fears, and everything in between.

They’d spend quiet afternoons walking through the city, side by side, sometimes getting coffee, sometimes just enjoying each other's company in comfortable silence. Zeeshan would often play his guitar for Amira, serenading her with soft tunes as they sat under the stars on his villa’s terrace. She’d smile, her head resting gently on his shoulder, as they watched the stars shining from the sky.

On one of those nights, as they sat under the stars, Zeeshan felt a question bubble up that had been on his mind ever since that first night on the terrace. He had always hesitated, unsure if it was too personal, but their connection had grown strong enough that he felt he could ask.

"Amira," he began softly, "I’ve been really curious about something. The scars on your wrists… how did you get them?"

Amira didn’t respond immediately. She looked up at the sky, her face illuminated by the moonlight. After a long pause, she sighed and turned toward him, a faint, vulnerable smile on her face.

“Zeeshan, do you believe in gods?” Amira asked, catching him off guard. Zeeshan hesitated, confused by the question.

Zeeshan blinked, taken aback by Amira’s unexpected question. “Gods?” he echoed, still processing her sudden shift in tone. He wasn’t sure where this was going, but he stayed silent, letting her continue.

Amira's voice took on a calm, almost philosophical cadence. "Well, they aren’t what people usually imagine. Gods... they’re just beings that existed long before humans ever came to be. They have control over things we can’t even begin to understand. You see, the primitive human brain,  even now, can’t comprehend these forces. So, they tried to make sense of it in ways they could—by weaving tales of miracles, curses, blessings, and divine punishment."

Zeeshan felt a chill run down his spine, the weight of her words heavy in the air. It was as if she wasn’t just talking about some distant mythology but something she had experienced firsthand.

Before he could ask more, she added, “The scars, Zeeshan... they’re a reminder of just how real they can be.”

Zeeshan scratched his head, clearly still puzzled. “I’m sorry, but I don’t really get it,” he said honestly. He didn’t really believe in gods, ghosts, or any of that stuff, but he wasn’t closed off to the idea either. He just hadn’t seen enough to convince him either way.

“So… what exactly are you trying to say?” he asked, trying to keep the conversation going without sounding dismissive. “I mean, I’m open to hearing it, but I’m not sure I fully understand.”

"Well," Amira started, her voice quiet but steady, "these beings that have existed for eons... they didn’t start out as good or bad. At first, they were just… there, existing without any need for morality. But over time, they developed their own ways of interacting with the world. Some chose to help people—acting as protectors or guides—and in return, humans would worship them, not just out of gratitude but because that belief gave these beings a kind of sustenance."

She paused for a moment, as if considering how to continue. “Others stayed distant, preferring to observe from afar, untouched by human affairs. And then there are those who enjoy meddling. To them, humans are more like… toys. Not out of cruelty necessarily, but because they see the world as something small and insignificant. Like kids poking at a beehive out of curiosity, not realizing—or maybe not caring—about the chaos they’re causing.”

She glanced at Zeeshan, gauging his reaction before adding, "To us, it might seem terrifying, but to them, it's just a game."

Zeeshan was fully absorbed in the conversation now, his curiosity piqued. “And what does this have to do with those scars?” he asked, his voice steady but filled with concern.

“I’m getting to that,” Amira replied softly. "Among these beings, there's one called Thanatos. Humans know him as the personification of death. The stories say that if he takes an interest in someone, he begins to find ways to pull them toward him. Slowly, quietly, the destination for those people becomes inevitable—death.”

Zeeshan's mind raced, the pieces beginning to connect. “So... are you saying you’ve felt suicidal because of this being? How do you even know they’re real?”

Amira shook her head firmly. “I’m not suicidal, Zeeshan. I love my life, every part of it. You've known me long enough to see that. But there are times when I feel... pulled toward something dark, like an invisible force trying to take control. I've done things—dangerous things—without realizing it at the time, only to snap out of it later. It’s almost like being hypnotized, but deeper. It’s not something I can easily explain. I know it sounds crazy, and I don’t expect you to believe it... but I know it’s real.”

"Does that mean that day on the terrace... you weren’t sleepwalking? Was it because of Thanatos?” Zeeshan asked, his voice quieter now, the gravity of the situation sinking in.

Amira nodded slowly. "Yes, I believe so. It wasn’t just sleepwalking—it was him, pulling me toward the edge. But you saved me. Your voice brought me back to reality. And ever since that day, when I met you, I haven’t felt that presence or that pull. I haven’t found myself in those dangerous situations, doing things I don’t mean to." She paused, looking at Zeeshan with a soft smile. "Maybe it’s because of you. Whatever it is, I’m grateful you're here. I’ve never felt this calm, this... free, in years."

Zeeshan wanted to lighten the mood, so he joked, "Maybe this Thanatos guy got scared of me."

Amira chuckled, adding playfully, "Or maybe he found someone better to play with."

“Now, let’s stop dwelling on stuff like this,” Amira said, her tone shifting to something more upbeat. “We shouldn’t ruin this beautiful night. Let’s talk about better things instead.”

Even though they spent a couple more hours together chatting about various topics, Zeeshan couldn’t shake off the heaviness in his heart. In the back of his mind, he worried for Amira. Was this some kind of psychological issue? Did she need help? He wasn’t sure.

As soon as Amira left, Zeeshan rushed to his room, grabbed his laptop, and dove into research about her condition. A flood of information hit him: schizophrenia, depression, hallucinations—an overwhelming number of possible diagnoses, all sharing similar symptoms. He spent hours poring over articles, his confusion and anxiety only growing with every new piece of information he encountered.

Eventually, he turned his focus to Thanatos. He stumbled down a rabbit hole of forums and channels discussing the figure. The more he read, the more unsettling it became. Stories emerged of people who had lost loved ones, many seemingly healthy and fine until they began displaying troubling behaviors. It was as if a dark shadow had crept into their lives, leading them to self-harm and, in some cases, tragically, to take their own lives.
No one had actually seen Thanatos; descriptions varied wildly. Some claimed he was an angel, others insisted he appeared as a man or even a woman. Some said he would manifest in dreams, while others claimed they could hear him whispering in the shadows. With so many versions and countless stories swirling around, it was difficult for Zeeshan to discern what to believe and what to dismiss. Each account seemed more fantastical than the last, adding to the weight of uncertainty pressing down on him.

As he glanced at the clock, a wave of exhaustion washed over him. Hours had slipped away, consumed by his futile quest for answers, and he realized he was chasing shadows in a headless, tailless story. The sun was on the verge of rising, casting a pale glow through his window.

Lately, sleep had become a stranger. Night after night, he was haunted by vivid dreams that felt all too real, pulling him back to the evening before his parents left for that fateful party.

In those dreams, he could see them bustling around the house, excitement radiating from their every move. They knelt beside him, their faces aglow with joy, urging him to join them. “Come with us, Zeeshan! It’ll be so much fun! We’ll all be together,” they’d say, their voices warm and inviting. Each time, he felt a flutter of hope, a yearning to be part of that moment. He could almost reach out, almost say yes.

But just as he opened his mouth to agree, a sudden jolt would rip him from that perfect scene, yanking him back to the cold, lonely reality of his room. He’d wake with a start, his heart racing, the echo of their laughter lingering in his ears.

The dreams were both a blessing and a curse, offering a glimpse of a life that could have been, only to snatch it away at the last moment. Every time he awoke, the familiar ache of loss settled in, a reminder that he could never reclaim those fleeting moments or the warmth of their presence.

Just as Zeeshan was about to shut down his laptop and surrender to sleep, a text flashed on his phone: “Goodbye.” Confusion washed over him as he recognized Amira's name on the screen. The weight of the message hit him like a cold wave, and a chill ran down his spine.

Glancing toward the window, he half-expected to see her standing there, but the room was eerily empty. Panic surged through him as he quickly pieced it together. Without a second thought, he dashed down to the living room, heart racing.

When he reached the terrace, he found Amira standing at the edge, her gaze fixed on him. It was as if time froze. Zeeshan’s mind screamed for him to call out, to tell her not to jump, but his voice was trapped in his throat, a silent plea lost in the air.

With fear propelling him, he bolted outside, urgency fueling his every step as he raced towards the building terrace, desperate to reach her before it was too late.

Zeeshan reached Amira just in time. She stood precariously at the edge, one arm outstretched, teetering on the brink. As he sprinted toward her, adrenaline coursing through his veins, he lunged forward, ready to grasp her arm. But in that fleeting moment, she stepped back, as if drawn by an invisible force.

Without thinking, he leaped too, his hand grabbing hers while the other clutched the ledge. They dangled in a heart-stopping embrace, suspended between life and death. The rush of adrenaline masked her weight, making it feel like they were weightless, hovering in an ethereal moment.

“I can pull you up,” he gasped, desperation lacing his voice, “and then I’ll follow.”

But Amira’s expression was unnervingly calm. “Is that what you really want?” she asked softly, her eyes searching his.

In that instant, realization struck him like a thunderbolt: perhaps this was exactly what she sought. She didn’t want to face the void alone. After everything they had shared, her desire was to leap into the abyss together, to escape the pain in unison.

Zeeshan's heart raced as he wrestled with the weight of her words. Thoughts of his own loneliness flooded his mind—his parents gone, his grandparents who had once offered him solace now lost to time. He felt utterly adrift, as if all that tethered him to this world had vanished.

“Maybe this is what I should do,” he thought, a dark clarity settling over him. “I have no one left. The only person who truly understands me is Amira. Perhaps we could find peace together.”

The gravity of the moment enveloped him, the air thick with the choices they faced. In that breathless space, he teetered on the edge—not just of the terrace, but of his own resolve, caught in the haunting allure of shared darkness.

With a final glance at the stars, which were barely visible now due to the encroaching morning light, he made his choice. He released his grip on the ledge, and in that instant, an inexplicable weight lifted from him. It felt as if all the burdens he had carried—the grief, the loneliness, the aching void—had fallen away. He and Amira were free, soaring into the unknown, the ground rushing up to meet them.
As they plummeted, a strange sense of calm enveloped him. For the first time in years, he felt alive—truly alive. They were united in their leap, a final act of defiance against a world that had offered them nothing but sorrow.
In those last seconds, a rush of memories flooded his mind—laughter shared, dreams whispered beneath the stars, the warmth of Amira’s presence. Each moment felt like a soft embrace, grounding him in a reality he wished to escape. And then, nothing but darkness.
